- **Backend**: PHP  
- **Database**: MySQL (Database schema provided in `carrental.sql`)  
- **Tools**: XAMPP/WAMP, PhpMyAdmin

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Landing page
- `login.php`, `register.php` – Authentication module
- `dashboard.php` – Admin/User dashboards
- `add_car.php`, `manage_car.php` – Car management
- `book_car.php` – Booking interface
- `transaction.php` – Transaction history
- `carrental.sql` – Database schema and initial data

## 📌 Key Features

## 🧩 Database Schema

The SQL file (`carrental.sql`) includes tables such as:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the project in your local server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Import `carrental.sql` into PhpMyAdmin to set up the database.
4. Update database credentials in PHP files (`config.php` or similar).
5. Launch `index.html` from your browser via `localhost`.
